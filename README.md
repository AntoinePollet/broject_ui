# Broject UI - Tailwind-styled Headless UI Components for Vue

## Overview

Broject UI is a Vue library that encapsulates the functionality of [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) while providing pre-styled components using Tailwind CSS. This library aims to simplify the integration of Headless UI components into your Vue projects by offering a set of components with Tailwind styling out of the box.

## Features

Ready-to-use Components: Broject UI includes a set of pre-styled Vue components based on Headless UI, allowing you to quickly integrate them into your project.

Tailwind CSS Integration: All components come with Tailwind CSS styling, ensuring a seamless fit into your project's design.

Full Customizability: Despite the pre-styling, you have complete control over the appearance and behavior of each component through the use of Headless UI's extensive set of props.

## Installation

`
npm install broject_ui
`

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on available components and their props, refer to the [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) documentation as Broject UI components closely follow the same API.
